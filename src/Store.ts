/**
 * Module for configuring a store.
 * 
 * It is actually a redux based data store, that lets you keep your application data in on place, allows you to access (get and update) the application state or subscribe to its listeners.
 * 
 * Two middlewares are built-in:
 * * [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) is as RxJS 5-based middleware for Redux. It's needed to compose and cancel async actions to create side effects and more, 
 * so that your app are able to get or post data to Sense/Net Content Repository through OData with ajax requests.
 * * [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) creates a detailed log on the dev toolbar console on all state changes.
 * You can add other middlewares too through the configureStore functions second param as an array of middlewares. But the built-in middlewares will be the part of the applied middleware group
 * in every way.
